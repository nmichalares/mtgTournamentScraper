# mtgTournamentScraper
Magic the Gathering online tournament result scraping tool, using HTMLAgilityPack 1.4.6.

So this is a little work in progress open source project that I wanted to put together to show how easy it is to grab data from a site and start analyzing it.

The scraper itself I want to leave open for anyone to grab and use, and I will be adding branches or forks later on to demonstrate some data analysis.

Any questions, contact me through gitHub.

This is no longer *officially* supported.
